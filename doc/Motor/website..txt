need to push 3mm at 2kg of force to ensure drop dispense

the torque required to produce a 2kg force using M4 Thread:
T = F*d/2 *(p+pi*u*d)/(pi*d-u*p)

T is the torque.
F = 20N is the axial force applied along the axis of the threaded fastener.
d = 3.54mm is the mean diameter of the thread. This is typically calculated as the average of the major and minor diameters of the thread.
p = 0.7 is the pitch of the thread, which is the distance between adjacent threads.
Î¼=0..2 is the coefficient of friction between the mating surfaces of the thread.

T=1.93 kg*cm

ideally we want to push 3mm in 1 sec. Assume const acc immediately followed by const deacc. motor need to turn 6/0.7 = 8.6 rev

RPM = 8.6 / 1 * 60 = 516

power required 
P = 1.02W
